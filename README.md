# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Using SQL to analyze database

Create Database Designs or Entity Relationship Diagrams

Design and manage tables

Write basic SQL (Structured Query Language) statements

Main questions:
Who would be retiring?
How many positions to fill?

Task build employee database

So far, Bobby would like to know the following:

What's going on with the salaries?


Why are there only five active managers for nine departments?


Why are some employees appearing twice?


To help Bobby find these answers, we're going to create tailored lists.

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
